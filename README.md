# PPL
PPL is the Parenthesis Programming Language, in which all elements (statements, parameters, blocks) are enclosed in parentheses. 
PPL includes a preprocessor to simplify the writing programs and reduce the number of parentheses.
PPL was developed  with Microsoft Developer Studio,C#, without using any third party packages.

PPL is interpreted language, source code (format scr)  is translated into intermediate representation (format ppl) for immedeately execution.

The main PPL features:

   -extensibility, using functionalities of C# and adding userâ€™s libraries by means of creating DLLs.
   
   -possibility to add all PPL-functionality to any user Applicaions.

This project includes TutorialPPL.pdf, command-line REPL utility (PPL interpreter) and other utilities , DLLs for using C# libraries, examples.
List of DLLs with C# functionalities will be expanded in the next versions.
CPPL.zip file it is framework-dependent win-x64 version.

Target framework .Net 7.0.

1. Unzip CPPL.VERSION.zip
2. Read TutorialPPL.VERSION.pdf
3. Run all examples - 
   cd cppl, 
   examples.bat
4. Run command-line interpreter - 
   cppl.exe or wppl.exe
