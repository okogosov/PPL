# PPL
PPL is the Parenthesis Programming Language, in which all elements (statements, parameters, blocks) are enclosed in parentheses. 
PPL includes a preprocessor to simplify the writing programs and reduce the number of parentheses.

Code, functions unctions and data are stored in PPL as several kinds of Trees â€“ 
root, NS, Functions, Configuration and may be displayed on Screen, saved and restored.

PPL configuration is defined in the file "Configuration.data" file and used when PPL runs or reloaded.

PPL is being developed  with Microsoft Developer Studio,C#, without using any third party packages.

PPL is interpreted language, source code (in the format "scr")  is translated into intermediate representation (in the format "ppl") for immediate execution.


File DesignPPL.pdf briefly describes the most important code processing steps.


The main PPL features:

   -extensibility, which allows users to use C# functionalities and add their own libraries by creating DLLs.
   
   -ability to add all PPL-functionality to any user Applicaions.

This project includes:

	TutorialPPL.pdf, 
	CPPL.zip:
	
	  -command-line REPL utility CPPL(PPL interpreter),
	
	  -Windows interpreter WPPL,
	
	  -utility ULC for generation user's library code,
	
	  -utility Assistant for presentation format all commands,
	
	  - DLLs for using C# libraries and others, 
	
	examples.
		
List of DLLs with C# functionalities will be expanded in the next versions.

Now PPL includes the following libraries:

	Array, ArrayList, Console, Convert, DataFrame, Dictionary, 
	
	Directory, Distributions, Excel, File, Math, MN_Numerics, 
	
	Queue, Random, Stack, Statistics, String, Vector.
	
CPPL.exe and WPPL.exe are framework-dependent win-x64 version.

Target framework .Net8.0 (CPPL.zip).

Target framework .Net7.0 (CPPL.NET7.zip).


1. Unzip CPPL.VERSION.zip
2. Read TutorialPPL.VERSION.pdf
3. Run all examples -
